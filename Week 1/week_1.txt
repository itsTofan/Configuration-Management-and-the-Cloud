Introduction to Automation at Scale
    Intro to Module 1: Automating with Configuration Management
        In this course introduction, the instructor emphasizes the importance of automation techniques, regardless of the team size or number of computers in a fleet. 
        They share their experience as part of the Site Reliability Engineering team supporting Gmail and highlight the significance of automation in meeting reliability 
        goals for a large-scale service. The course aims to teach automation concepts, configuration management using Puppet, and treating infrastructure as code. By learning 
        these concepts, students can effectively manage a growing number of devices without needing to expand the team. The instructor also mentions that automation allows 
        teams to handle more work with the same number of people and frees up time for more interesting tasks. By the end of the course module, students will have the skills 
        to fix bugs in existing automation and develop their own automated solutions. The course is designed to provide practical knowledge and opportunities to apply automation 
        techniques effectively.
    What is scale?
        When we talk about scale in the context of computer systems, it means the ability to handle increased workloads or a growing number of resources without a proportional 
        increase in effort. A scalable system can accommodate increased demand by expanding its capacity. For example, a scalable web application can handle more users by adding 
        more servers to serve requests. Scaling is essential for flexible and efficient operations.
        
        To determine how scalable a system is, one can ask questions like how easily new servers can be added, installed, and configured, and whether this can be done with the 
        existing IT team or if more people are required. Scaling also applies to processes like onboarding new employees and managing system administration tasks, such as applying 
        security policies and patches. Automation is the key to achieving scalable operations.
        
        Automation tools allow tasks to be completed more efficiently. For instance, deploying a new server can be done with a single command, and user accounts can be created 
        automatically based on stored data. Automation empowers small IT teams to manage hundreds or thousands of computers effectively.
        
        To achieve automation, one can use tools like configuration management, which helps automate managing computers in a fleet. Configuration management streamlines tasks 
        like software installation, server configuration, and user account management, contributing to a scalable and efficient infrastructure.
    
    What is configuration management?
        This section discusses the concept of configuration management and the benefits of using managed configuration over unmanaged configuration for computer systems. Configuration 
        management involves handling all aspects of a device's configuration, from the operating system to applications and policies. Manually deploying servers with unmanaged 
        configuration may be feasible for a small number of devices, but it becomes challenging and time-consuming as the fleet grows.
        
        To address scalability issues, configuration management systems are introduced. These systems automate the deployment and management of configurations for a fleet of devices. 
        They apply defined rules to ensure consistency and efficiency across all managed systems. Popular configuration management tools include Puppet, Chef, Ansible, and CFEngine, 
        among others.
        
        The focus of this course is on Puppet, which is considered the current industry standard for configuration management. However, it's essential to choose the tool that best 
        suits the specific infrastructure needs, whether locally hosted or cloud-based. The infrastructure as code paradigm is introduced as a way to optimize the use of configuration 
        management systems.
        - Nodes
        - Puppet, Chef, Ansible, CFEngine - locally hosted instructor
        - Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Amazon AWS
    
    What is infrastructure as code? 
        In this section, the concept of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is introduced. When using a configuration management system, the configuration rules for managing devices are 
        written and executed by automation, ensuring that the computers match the desired state. Storing all the configuration in version-controlled files and using automation to 
        provision and manage nodes is known as IaC.
        
        The benefits of IaC include rapid deployment of new devices in case of failures, consistency, versioning, reliability, and repeatability. By treating machines as replaceable
        resources and using automation, IaC allows for easy scalability and adaptability to changing IT requirements. Configuration files in IaC can be version-controlled, providing 
        an audit trail of changes, easy rollback, improved collaboration, and automated testing for configuration correctness.
        
        IaC is applicable not only to large data centers but also to smaller environments, including laptops, workstations, and single servers. The ability to quickly recover from 
        outages and the flexibility to deploy infrastructure with minimal overhead are significant advantages of IaC.
        
        Overall, IaC enables IT teams to adapt to the evolving technology industry and handle capacity requirements for growth efficiently. The section concludes with a mention of 
        a practice quiz to check understanding.



Introduction to Puppet
    What is Puppet?
        Puppet is the current industry standard for managing computer configurations in a fleet. It's an open-source tool created in 2005, evolving through different versions with user 
        feedback, and the latest version is Puppet 6. It uses a client-server architecture, with the Puppet agent (client) connecting to the Puppet master (service). The agent sends facts 
        describing the computer to the master, which generates a list of rules to be applied and sends it back to the agent for implementation.
        
        Puppet is cross-platform, compatible with Linux distributions, Windows, and macOS, enabling the use of the same rules for managing various computers. Rules in Puppet are defined 
        in a simple syntax. An example is given to illustrate how rules work, such as ensuring the presence of the 'sudo' package on every computer where the rule is applied. Puppet can 
        perform various tasks, including installing packages, configuring files and registry entries, managing services, users, and groups, and executing external commands.
        
        While the course will cover essential concepts of configuration management and Puppet, it won't delve into every detail. The goal is to provide a foundational understanding of 
        configuration management and Puppet, with pointers to additional resources for further exploration. The next topic will focus on different resources used to define rules in Puppet.

    Puppet Resources
        Resources are the fundamental units for modeling the configuration to be managed. Each resource represents one 
        configuration element, such as a service, package, or file. The resource type is declared using a keyword, and its configuration is specified inside curly braces.
        
        Two examples are provided: one for a file resource that ensures the existence of a directory, and another for a file resource that configures the contents of a specific file 
        (/etc/timezone). Each resource has attributes that can be set, such as the type of resource, its contents, and whether it should replace existing content.
        
        Puppet agents are responsible for turning the desired state of resources into reality using providers. The agent automatically selects the appropriate provider based on the 
        resource and the environment. Providers are code that handles the necessary changes to make the computer match the desired state defined in the resource.
        
        The video concludes by mentioning that multiple resources can be combined to create more complex Puppet classes, which will be covered in the next topic. It's highlighted that 
        the official documentation provides a comprehensive list of resource attributes and their usage.

    Puppet Classes
        In Puppet, classes are used to collect related resources in a single place, making it easier to manage and understand the configuration. For example, a class could group 
        resources that install a package, configure a file, and start a service related to a specific application.
        
        An example class is shown that manages the Network Time Protocol (NTP), with three resources: a package to ensure NTP is always upgraded to the latest version, a file to set 
        the configuration using the source attribute, and a service to enable and run the NTP service.
        
        Using classes allows for better organization and easier maintenance of configurations. Resources can be grouped based on their related functionality, such as log files, time 
        zone settings, temporary files, or specific application configurations like web servers or email infrastructure.
        
        The video concludes by mentioning that more advanced practices and common approaches when using configuration management tools, like Puppet, will be covered in future videos. 
        A reading with more information on Puppet syntax and resources is provided, followed by a quiz to check understanding.


The Building Blocks of Configuration Management

    What are domain-specific languages?
        In Puppet, the domain-specific language (DSL) is a limited programming language designed specifically for configuration management tasks. Unlike general-purpose programming languages 
        like Python or Java, Puppet's DSL is focused on defining and applying configuration rules to manage devices efficiently.
        
        The Puppet DSL includes variables, conditional statements, and functions, allowing for more complex operations and decision-making when applying configuration management rules. 
        One essential concept in Puppet is "facts," which are variables representing characteristics of the system being managed. Puppet's agent gathers information about the system, 
        stores it as facts, and sends them to the server to calculate the appropriate rules to apply.
        
        Puppet comes with built-in core facts, such as OS type, memory information, virtual machine status, and IP addresses. If needed, custom facts can be written to collect specific 
        information for decision-making in Puppet rules.
        
        An example of Puppet code utilizing facts and the DSL is shown. The code uses the "is-virtual" fact to decide whether to install or purge the "smartmontools" package. It 
        demonstrates variable usage, conditional statements, and resource definition syntax.
        
        Learning Puppet's DSL is relatively straightforward compared to general-purpose programming languages due to its simplicity and focused purpose in configuration management. 
        Configuration management tools generally use their own DSL, tailored to their specific tasks, which makes learning them quick and efficient.
    
    The Driving Principles of Configuration Management
        In Puppet, configuration management is achieved using a declarative language, which means that the desired state of the system is specified rather than the steps to achieve it. 
        This is in contrast to procedural languages like Python or C, where explicit steps are written to reach a goal. By declaring the desired state, Puppet's providers (e.g., apt, yum) 
        are responsible for determining and executing the necessary actions to achieve that state.
        
        An essential property of configuration management tools, including Puppet, is idempotency. An action is considered idempotent if it can be performed multiple times without changing 
        the system after the first execution and without causing unintended side effects. Most Puppet resources provide idempotent actions, meaning that running the same rules multiple times 
        leads to the same end result.
        
        The "test and repair" paradigm is another characteristic of configuration management tools like Puppet. It means that actions are only taken when necessary to achieve a goal. Puppet 
        first tests to see if a resource needs modification. If the resource is already in the desired state, no action is taken, thus avoiding unnecessary operations.
        
        Puppet is stateless, meaning there is no state being maintained between Puppet agent runs. Each Puppet run is independent, with the agent collecting the current facts, the master 
        generating rules based on those facts, and the agent applying the rules accordingly.
        
        Using the declarative approach, idempotent actions, test and repair paradigm, and stateless nature of Puppet, you can efficiently manage a large number of computers in a consistent 
        and reliable manner.
